- Henry
- First year master student at Northwestern U studying analytics
- I have been immersed in the whole data science workflow, and have extensive experience working with data analysis tools like Python, Pandas, sklearn, SQL, etc. 
    - Recent projects include
        - analyzing point of sales data from dillard's department stores
        - Developing a data pipline and prediction models for Divvy bikes to predict the # of trips at a certain station in the next hour, and deploying it on AWS as well as NU's own platform REFIT
        - Startup, FitX, combines fitness and AI. We're making an exercise tracker with computer vision to determine if an exercise has been done correctly, will also give recommendations based on the correctness.
    - can go into detail later on.

- I'm really intrigued by the combination of data science with an industry that people usually dont think about being able to be enhanced by data. I think this is the beauty of data science. It's very behind the scenes and unassuming, but it is the foundation for many critical business decisions.

- When i'm not working, I like working on old cars and going to the gym.
