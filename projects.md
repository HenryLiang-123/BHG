 - Point of sales data from Dillard's department stores
        - More than 161 Million lines of data from 5 tables
        - Joined tables with each other and external data to conducted feature engineering 
            - Created variables like seasonality, region, average percent discount, purchase / return ratio, brand prestige
        - Using final dataset to conduct clustering analysis
            - Cluster items based on features such as color, region, seasonality (feature selection underway, will probably use PCA)
            - Will try various clustering algorithms (kmeans, DBSCAN. researching more atm)
            - Produce basic recommendation system (e.g. if a customer buys say a red shirt, we might recommend something in the same cluster, like red pants)
    
    - Developing use cases for
